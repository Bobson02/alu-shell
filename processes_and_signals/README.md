How to Use
Execution Permissions:

Ensure all scripts have execution permissions. You can grant these permissions by running the following command in the directory:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x shell_scripts/* process_management/* signal_handling/* file_permissions/*
Running Scripts:

Navigate to the directory containing the desired script and execute it by typing:
bash
Copy code
./script_name.sh
For example, to run script1.sh from the shell_scripts directory:
bash
Copy code
cd shell_scripts
./script1.sh
Understanding Output:

Each script is commented to explain its purpose and functionality. Read the comments within the scripts to understand what each part does.
Some scripts may require input or arguments. Ensure you follow the instructions provided within the comments.
